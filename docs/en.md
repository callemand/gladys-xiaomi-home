# Xiaomi Home

Control the robot vacuums of your Xiaomi Home account from Gladys Assistant.

This integration targets robots **paired in the Xiaomi Home (Mi Home) app**. It
talks to them **directly over your local network**, with an automatic fallback to
the Xiaomi cloud when a robot is not reachable.

> If your robot is paired in the **Roborock app**, it answers on an entirely
> different service: the **Roborock** integration is the one you need. Both can be
> installed at once if you use both apps.

## Features

For every robot of your account:

- **State** — the operational state of the robot (cleaning, paused, returning to
  the dock, charging, docked, error…).
- **Run mode** — start or stop a cleaning cycle.
- **Clean mode** — the suction level (silent, balanced, turbo, max, gentle).
- **Dock** — send the robot back to its charging dock.
- **Battery** — the current battery level, in percent.
- **Last clean start** and **Cleaned today** — when the last cleaning started,
  and whether it was today (1) or not (0). Use **Cleaned today** as a scene
  condition, for example to start a cleaning only if the robot has not run yet.

## Scenes

The robot can **start a scene** when it starts or finishes a cleaning, returns to
its dock, runs low on battery (20 %), finishes charging, reports an error, when a
consumable is worn (10 % left), or on any change of state.

A scene can also **command the robot**: start, pause, stop, return to the dock,
clean some rooms (their names separated by commas, e.g. "Kitchen, Living room"),
or set the suction power.

Scenes need Gladys 5.1.0 or later.

## Map widget

Add the **Vacuum** widget to a dashboard and pick your robot: it shows the
battery, the cleaned surface, the map with your rooms, the state and the wear
of each consumable, with Start and Dock buttons plus two buttons you choose in
its settings. While the robot cleans, the map refreshes about every 15 seconds.

The map is fetched through the **Xiaomi cloud**, even when the robot answers on
your local network, and only robots built by Roborock (S5, S6, S7…) provide it.

## Configuration

1. Click **Connect**: the Xiaomi sign-in page opens.
2. Approve it (you can also scan it with the Xiaomi Home app).
3. The badge turns green on its own.
4. Open the **Discovery** screen and start a scan: your robots appear and can be
   added to Gladys.

> You **never** type your Xiaomi password into Gladys, and this is only needed
> **once**: the session is stored and reused automatically after a restart.

To use another Xiaomi account, or after revoking the access, click
**Disconnect**: Gladys forgets the session and restarts the integration, then
**Connect** links an account again.

There is **nothing to configure**: the Xiaomi server region, your robots, their
local encryption keys and their IP addresses are all discovered automatically.

## How it works

The integration discovers your robots through the Xiaomi cloud, along with their
local encryption key and IP address. Commands and state readings then go through
the **local network** first (encrypted miIO protocol), falling back to the cloud
when a robot is unreachable. The transport in use is shown as a badge on the
device.

Turn off **Prefer the local (LAN) connection when available** in the
integration settings to send commands through the Xiaomi cloud first instead,
with the local network as the fallback.

## Limitations

- **Robot vacuums only.** The name matches the app, but a Xiaomi Home account
  carries many other device types and none of them is handled here.
- Suction-level codes vary across model generations. If your model behaves
  differently, open an issue with the `fan_power` value visible in the debug
  logs.
